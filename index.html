        <h2 id="topic1">1.0 - Respect channel topics.</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1</strong> - Every channel in the server has its own texting purposes. You cannot text randomly in any channel in the server. You have to make sure to read the channel topic before chatting, or head over to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/986982849330675742/1160912658522980426" style="color: #3b86ff !important; text-decoration: none;">Channel topic usage information</a></p>

        <h2 id="topic2">2.0 - Illegal Activities.</h2>
        <p><strong>2.1</strong> - Donâ€™t use self-bots, nitro snipers, auto changing statuses, API exploits, or do anything that harms the server. Discussing these topics is a bit touchy. If you say you did these things before or you are currently doing them, then you will be punished.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2</strong> - Don't attempt to ping everyone or attempt to run joke raid commands/say that you've raided a discord server before or that you're a raider. If you are suggesting that people raid or doxx someone, you will be punished. If you share someoneâ€™s doxx, you are also doxxing them and will get banned.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3</strong> - 1.4. Donâ€™t use Discord to scam or send malware / viruses. We do not allow these kind of activity in our server, and if you're found doing such, you'll be permanently banned.</p>
        
        <h2 id="topic3">3.0 - No NSFW Content / Gore / Being Weird.</h2>
        <p><strong>3.0</strong> - Donâ€™t talk about NSFW content, about genitals, doing reference of them or joking about them. Talking about sex (or any other sexual activity), genitals, kinks, fanfiction, or any other content meant to inflict arousal will lead to moderation.</p>
        <p><strong>3.1</strong> - No <strong>N</strong>ot <strong>S</strong>afe <strong>F</strong>or <strong>L</strong>ife or gore content. Videos or content that contain the previous mentioned or things that nobody wants to see, or discussion about these topics, is strictly prohibited.</p>

Don't go around saying "I have a folder full of NSFW" or "I like minors", it's completely weird and unaccepeted. This includes flirting with minors. Do not flirt with anyone in the server ESPECIALLY the minors.</p>

        <h2 id="topic4">4.0 - Be respectful to everyone.</h2>
        <p><strong>4.1</strong> - It's important to be nice to everyone in the server. No one's looking for a toxic chat with each other, this is a healthy community which we maintain healthy chats inside. No one wants someone to come and randomly being rude or toxic, and disliking everything just to piss off someone. Stay calm, nice, like everyone wants in the server.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2</strong> - Donâ€™t be racist/make fun of colors/joke about them, sexist, send death threats, or engage in hate speech. We strictly disallow these kind of behaviors here. Telling someone "kys" or that they should go kill themselves are considered as death threats, which are disallowed. Telling someone "I hate blacks", or "i hate n##ers", or making fun of the white or black color is a complete form of racism, and you'll be directly banned if you're caught doing so.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3</strong> - Sensitive topics. If you want to discuss something sensitive with a member of the server, kindly take it to DMs, as the general is supposed to have only healthy topics in it.
            
        <h2 id="topic5">5.0 - Political Discussions.</h2>
        <p><strong>5.1</strong> - Political discussions in the server can create controversial topics in general. We strictly don't allow Nazism in the server aswell, such as people roleplaying as Hitler or more. No talking about these topics aswell.</p>

        <p><strong>6.1</strong> - Profiles in the server should be SFW, should no contain pronographic content in them or a status which is not SFW. If your profile violates these rules you will be banned from the server.</p>
        <p><strong>6.2</strong> - Impersonating anyone especially the staff team of Sapro is not allowed at all. Joking's also not allowed.</p>
        
        <h2 id="topic7">7.0 - Talking to newcomers./</h2>
        <p><strong>7.1</strong> - If a new member joins the server, please try not to act weird or continue talking about stuff outta the context. If many people already used the welcome bot button to welcome the member, please try to welcome the new member with your own words, so the chat doesn't get flooded. Acting weird and making the new member uncomfortable in the server is a huge punishment, so try your best to accompany the new member in the server.</p>
        
        <h2 id="topic8">8.0 - Automod/Moderation.</h2>
    <p><strong>8.1</strong> - Bypassing automod or attempting to bypass it is not allowed, and will come with even more severe punishments.</p>

    <p class="exclude-dropdown"><strong>9.1</strong> - Please use common sense. Not every rule mentioned above or inside the server's #rule channel can be listed, so if you want to do something but you're not sure, please contact a staff member first before doing it.
